# Food Finds

A platform that allows university students to order food from vendors on their campus. Students choose the school they are in to see the available vendors and place an order. Vendors can create an account that allows them to sell their food. They can add food, set a price for it and see purchases made by their customers. Each school has their own admin account that can approve or reject vendors.
